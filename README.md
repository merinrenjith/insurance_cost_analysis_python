# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis (Python • Pandas • Seaborn)

This project analyzes how demographic and lifestyle factors influence U.S. medical insurance charges using the famous *insurance.csv* dataset.

The goals of the analysis were to understand how:  
- Smoking status  
- Sex  
- Region  
- BMI and BMI categories  
impact medical insurance costs.
